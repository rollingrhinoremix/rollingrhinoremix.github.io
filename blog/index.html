                    <h1>Community-led innovation + Development underway for 2022.09.01</h1>
                    <p>The Rolling Rhino Remix team has been hard at work to begin the development of the next disk image release. Besides that the development team have also been working on providing more power to the Rolling Rhino Remix community.</p>
                    <h2>Becoming a community distribution</h2>
                    <p>We wanted to become a distribution created by the community, for the community and so we have implemented a number of changes for this. Rolling Rhino Remix has evolved into a fundamentally different distribution than what was envisioned. There have been countless times where the community has submitted pull requests which completely change the distribution for the better. We are relying on contributors more than ever now. With the personal lives of developers having become increasingly busy, we need your help. To do this, the community, along with the former development team will now be leading the development of the distribution.</p>
                    <p>The role of official developers will be transformed into "Core Contributors", and they shall receive read/write access to repositories so that they are able to merge and submit pull requests to their respective repositories. Any developer with an exceptional record of active commits or innovation can become a trusted contributor. Chadano will remain as the Project Lead behind the distribution to help guide the development of the next releases as well as utility development. Upon the resignation of any Project Lead, the wider-community may vote on which core contributor should assume the position.</p>
                    <p><i>We need help from the community now more than ever to help see the project succeed and meet release deadlines, and we need <b>your</b> help to do it. </i></p>
                    <h2>2022.09.01 development begins</h2>
                    <p>The development cycle of Rolling Rhino Remix kicks off once again with the development officially beginning on disk image 2022.09.01. The changes in this disk image release will be minimal, with all package and utility versions being shipped at their latest version by default as well as the 5.19.x kernel being pre-packaged in the distribution.</p>
                    <p>We aim to release a seperate Windows Subsystem for Linux binary for Windows developers to utilise to take full advantage of the Rolling Rhino Remix utilities and packages within their Windows machines. The installation for this will be detailed on our Wiki once released.</p>

                    <p>It's been a month since the last disk image release of Rolling Rhino Remix. The development team has worked hard to squash issues in this release as well as improve the quality of life for the user.</p>

                    <p>The Rolling Rhino Remix development team has begun development on 2022.08.01 which will see small-scale changes. The largest change is the deprecation of <code>rhino-init</code>, with all required directories and files being created on disk image generation. 2022.08.01 will also see the upgrades of packages and kernel version.</p>

                    <p><code>rhino-update</code> has seen many small-scale changes accumulate over-time through development pull requests, so they've now been compiled into a tagged release.</p>

                    <h1>Release 2022.07.01</h1>
                    <p>It's been over a month since the last disk image release of Rolling Rhino Remix has released. We recently shifted our release model to just compile the latest updates to the distribution and release them in monthly disk images. This change was necessary as Rolling Rhino Remix reached a natural stagnation in its development where core distribution features were not required to be developed anymore.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What's new?</b> <br />
                        <p>
                            &bull; Rolling Rhino Remix 2022.07.01 is the first disk image to have the latest Linux kernel packaged and pre-compiled for the distribution. Linux kernel 5.18.8 is now included by default. <br />
                            &bull; The latest releases for our rhino-config and rhino-deinst utility have been packaged in this monthly disk image release.<br />
                            &bull; Nala has now been included in the distribution by default. Nala is a libapt-pkg front-end which has amazing features such as Parallel downloads, better output formatting, transaction history and more. <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>If you are using an already existing installation of Rolling Rhino Remix then you will be able to upgrade to the latest version with <code>rhino-update</code> if you do not have these changes already.</p>
                        <p>If you wish to download Rolling Rhino Remix with a fresh disk image then you can download it <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/download">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>This version of Rolling Rhino Remix was released two days later than expected. The reason for this was due to time constraints in our personal lives such as College, School and Work. One major bug presented itself in our testing stage on the 30th of June and so we had to fix that as well. We apologise for the late release of this disk image.</p>
                    </p>
                    <p>To receive the latest upgrades to your system, please run <code>rhino-update</code>.</p>
                    <hr />
                </div>

                <div id="rhino-update-150">
                    <h1>rhino-update v1.5 - Nala integration</h1>
                    <p>The Rolling Rhino Remix project has worked closely with the lead developer of the <a href="https://gitlab.com/volian/nala" target="_blank">Nala</a> project, Volitank. We have partnered up with them to bring Nala to the distribution and utilise it within rhino-update.</p>
                    <p>Nala is a front-end for libapt-pkg. It has many great features that make it a great alternative to utilising the apt command itself, while keeping the same core functionality of downloading and installing .deb packaged from repositories. Especially for newer users it can be hard to understand what apt is trying to do when installing or upgrading. Outside of pretty formatting, the number 1 reason to use Nala over apt is parallel downloads. Nala is much faster at apt when it comes to updating repositories as well as installing or upgrading packages. The formatting makes it much more human readable. 
                    </p>
                    <p>So, how was it integrated? Rolling Rhino Remix now has Nala preinstalled on all systems once an update has occured. The next disk image release, 2022.07.01, will also contain the Nala package preinstalled. It is recommended to install and remove packages via Nala instead of apt now. To update your packages, it is still recommended to utilise <code>rhino-update</code>. Rhino-update will now utilise Nala for package upgrades.</p>

                    <h1>rhino-config v3.0 & rhino-update v1.4 released!</h1>
                    <p>The development team has been hard at work for two big updates to Rolling Rhino Remix utilities, as rhino-config gets the long awaited update that allows for you to switch to alternate Linux-based Kernels such as xanmod and liquorix. Our update utility, rhino-update also receives many quality of life changes.</p>
                    <h2>rhino-config v3.0</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>What's changed?</b> <br />
                        &bull; The mainline flag has been removed from rhino-config, with the latest Linux kernel, delivered straight from the Ubuntu mainline repositories, being installed by default on an update. <br />
                        &bull; A new sub-command, <code>rhino-config switch-kernel</code>, allows for the ability to switch to an alternate Linux kernel.
                    </p>
                    <p>It is recommended you read the <a href="https://github.com/rollingrhinoremix/docs/wiki/rhino-config" target="_blank">rhino-config Wiki page</a> so you have information on how to utilise the new sub-commands. <br /> &bull; It is important to note that the Wiki may take a short while to be updated.</p>
                    <h2>rhino-update v1.4</h2>
                    <p>
                        <b>What's changed?</b> <br />
                        &bull; If Flatpak is installed on the system, Flatpak applications will be updated automatically via rhino-update. <br />
                        &bull; A bug fix to not update Pacstall as root has been applied. <br />
                        &bull; A minor change to use the latest tagged release automatically for rhino utilities. <br />
                        &bull; A bug fix to not rely on rhino-config configuration files to check if snapd is installed to handle Snap application updates. <br />
                        &bull; System files such as /etc/os-release are updated by rhino-update. Standards are also now adhered to. <br />
                        &bull; The ability to install alternate kernels has been provided. This feature runs in parallel to rhino-config v3.0. <br />
                        &bull; Kernel files are now downloaded simultaneously, which will make upgrade times significantly faster.
                    </p>
                    <p>The majority of these changes happened in incremental steps, and users will have received most of these changes already, but they are now compiled into one release.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, some new features such as rhino-config v3.0, the ability to install alternate kernels, as well as simultaneously downloading kernel files have just been released. To receive the latest upgrades to your system, please run <code>rhino-update</code>.</p>

                    <h1>Development underway for 2022.07.01 + New updates coming soon</h1>
                    <p>Development has begun for the release of our next disk image, which will now be released on July 1st. With most of the necessary major changes happening to the distribution, the release of new disk images will focus more on polishing and refining the user experience from out of the box, as well as compiling the latest changes provided by our team and within the Ubuntu repositories. The big change to note for this release will be that the latest Linux kernel, straight from the Ubuntu mainline PPA, will be used as the default Linux kernel from now on, rather than the default Ubuntu kernel, which can sometimes lag behind in versions. As a result of this, the mainline option is being removed in rhino-config.</p>
                    <h2>Utility updates</h2>
                    <p>rhino-config is getting a refresh with v3.0.0 which is set to release soon. This version will see the aforementioned removal of the mainline flag being removed from the utility. New changes will also include a brand new subcommand called switch-kernel, which will allow you to choose alternate Linux kernels to utilise such as the xanmod and liquorix kernel.</p>
                    <p>rhino-deinst has seen various pull requests, which will be compiled into the next release. These changes are relatively minor, with some reorganisation and bug fixes for LXDE.</p>
                    <h2>Website updates</h2>
                    <p>The website is going to get a bold new look, with our former rhino-update maintainer, Billy G, taking over the website development. The website will now feature a more modern look inspired by <a href="https://gnome.org">gnome.org</a>, and will now utilise a dark mode colour pallete.</p>

                    <h1>Release 2022.05.28 + more</h1>
                    <p>After over three weeks of development we are proud to release 2022.05.28. This release has been our most ambitious release yet, with the launch of a brand-new utility, a minimal installation mode and more new features.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What's new?</b> <br />
                        &bull; New minimal installation option is available in the Ubuntu Ubiquity Installer. <br />
                        &bull; Our new utility, rhino-deinst, which installs Desktop Environments and Window Managers easily through a Terminal User Interface has been included in the distribution by default. <br />
                        &bull; Our disk images are now built with our brand new RRR-builder build system. This uses ZSTD compression which saves space.<br />
                        &bull; Our brand-new wallpapers have been included into the system by default. These wallpapers will automatically change between light and dark depending on whether you have set your system to use light or dark mode. <br />
                        &bull; In addition, these wallpapers can be selected from gnome control center or the settings app. The background will change depending on if dark mode is enabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>Originally our minimal installation option was planned to be a seperate disk image, however we decided through its development that it would be best to include it in the standard Rolling Rhino Remix disk image, and modify Ubiquity's currently existing Minimal installation option to provide a minimalistic setup with no preinstalled Desktop Environment or extra packages.</p>
                    <p>If you are using an already existing installation of Rolling Rhino Remix then you will be able to upgrade to the latest version with <code>rhino-update</code>.</p>
                    <p>If you wish to download Rolling Rhino Remix with a fresh disk image then you can download it <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/download">here</a>.</p>
                    <h2>Documentation has been ported to our GitHub Wiki</h2>
                    <p>We have deccided that the best way to provide adequate documentation is through a community maintained Wiki. We have utilities GitHub's Wiki feature for this reason. All documentation has been ported to the GitHub Wiki and we will be utilising the Wiki for documentation from now on. The documentation page on our website has been removed and our menu now links to the Wiki instead.</p>
                    <h2>New release cycle</h2>
                    <p>Our new release cycle sees Rolling Rhino Remix releasing monthly disk images instead. These disk images will see relatively little feature change, however they will compile the latest package updates as well as the latest updates from our utilities and new utilities if they are created. The next disk image release will occur on the 1st July 2022.</p>

                <div id="development-update-4">
                    <h1>Why we are delaying the release of our next disk image</h1>
                    <p>We are sorry to announce but our next disk image will not release on 2022.05.21 as initially planned, instead it will recieve an additional 7 days of development and release on the 28th of May instead. The reason for this additional time is for a few reasons:</p>
                    <p>
                        &bull; We are now going to be providing Rolling Rhino Remix with a minimal disk image, this disk image will be based on the daily builds of Ubuntu server, and will provide users with a more Arch Linux style install, with only the base packages they will require for their system. <br />
                        &bull; We have a brand-new build system, known as RRR-builder which generates disk images. This is a departure from Cubic, which was our previous method of disk image creation. We would like the time to adequately test and fix issues in this brand new disk image builder. <br />
                        &bull; We have a brand new Rhino utility in the works that was designed specifically designed for Rolling Rhino Remix minimal. It will be known as rhino-deinst and is a Terminal User Interface desktop environment installer. It will be installed and usable on both minimal and full-desktop Rolling Rhino Remix. <br />
                        &bull; The disk image size has been reduced because of ZSTD compression.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What will happen to Rolling Rhino Remix from now then?</h2>
                    <p>Not much will change. Users who still wish to have the Ubuntu-desktop preinstalled by default can use our "Rolling Rhino Remix - Full Desktop" disk image. This will provide them with the exact same experience that Rolling Rhino Remix currently has. Users who wish to use the Minimal disk image will have a slightly more difficult installation, however a system with no pre-installed desktop environment or extra packages. This is especially good for perfectionists who like to have full control over their system. Users who utilise our minimal disk image can use our new utility, rhino-deinst, to easily install a desktop environment.</p>

                    <h2>Release 2022.05.21:</h2>
                    <p>Development has begun on the next release. The development team have taken feedback from users and contributors to see what features users will want the most. Rolling Rhino Remix will now begin to include the latest Linux kernel by default. The mainline Linux kernel has a list of benefits and drawbacks. By default the mainline Linux kernel does not provide ZFS support, however the disk image will now also come packaged with <code>zfs-dkms</code> to provide the support for this. Users who already have Rolling Rhino Remix installed will have it installed on a system upgrade. The most exciting change in this release will be our brand-new wallpapers, which will provide a nicer splash of colour to the desktop and will integrate better with our new brand identity. The two new wallpapers automatically change between light and dark whenever you change your desktop theme between light and dark mode. To get a sneak peak at the new wallpapers, you can go view them on our <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/branding">branding page</a>.</p>
                    <h2>Updates to our rhino utilities:</h2>
                    <p>Both of our Rhino utilities will get some big updates in this release cycle. Our rhino-update utility will now automatically install the latest Linux kernel, have the ability to verify Linux kernel checksums and recieve some code cleanup. Our configuration utility, rhino-config, will no longer have the option to support the mainline Linux kernel due to it being installed by default on all systems.</p>
                    <p>&bull; If users would prefer to utilise the Ubuntu kernel as opposed to the mainline Linux kernel, they are able to select it in the GRUB boot menu on system startup.</p>

                    <h1>Changes to our brand</h1>
                    <p>Rolling Rhino Remix has gone through a major brand redesign before the next release. This includes brand new logos, new wallpapers and a brand-new website.</p>
                    <p>We believe that a good brand is essential for any project. Logos should be instantly recognisable and visible when small, and websites should be unique and readable. We have undergone major design changes to bring the best possible experience to Rolling Rhino Remix. Everything evolves, and Rolling Rhino Remix is no different, going through three website and brand design changes since the beginning of the project, however we have now created a brand identity which we believe encapsulates what Rolling Rhino Remix is about, while being unique and sticking to our Ubuntu roots.</p>
                    <p>We have now established a set of brand guidelines which you can view <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/branding">here</a>. Our set of Brand Guidelines exist so that Rolling Rhino Remix is communicated with the same precision we used to create it.</p>
                    <p>We hope you enjoy these new changes to Rolling Rhino Remix, and our brand.</p>

                    <h1>rhino-update v1.3 - Quality of life</h1>
                    <p>Our upgrade utility, rhino-update has received its first major update in almost 12 days. These changes include some tweaks to improve our upgrade utility and general quality of life changes.</p>
                    <p>
                        &bull; A brand-new feature that ensures that the mainline Linux kernel is not installed twice. This was created to help save bandwidth if required. If users have a slower internet connection, running an upgrade can take a long while, especially if the same kernel is being reinstalled. <br />
                        &bull; An important bug fix that allows for Pacstall to be installed, rather than giving an error. Now users are able to install Pacstall onto their system once again.
                    </p>
                    <p>To receive the latest updates, please run <code>rhino-update</code> to upgrade your system.</p>

                    <h1>Development is underway for 2022.05.03!</h1>
                    <p>Development has begun for the next disk image release. A lot of small changes are going into this release to create the best possible user experience. The newly packaged rhino-config v2.0 binaries will be provided by default, along with a set of brand-new wallpapers. At the moment we are unsure whether the default wallpaper will change, but some alternatives will be provided in <code>/usr/share/backgrounds/rolling-backgrounds</code>. Other small changes such as the rest of the <code>config-v2</code> update that was pushed to rhino-update will also be provided by default, and all packages will be updated to their latest versions.</p>
                    <p>This is the first disk image that will be built on top of the released Jammy disk image, and so when you switch to the devel series with <code>rhino-init</code>, it will prompt an error similar to <code>E: expected Jammy but got Kinetic.</code>, This can be rectified by hitting “y” (for yes) to switch the devel series to track Kinetic. Your system will still be Rolling, it just means that the development branch is now tracking the upcoming Ubuntu release.</p>
                    <hr />
                </div>

                <div id="config-v2">
                    <h1>rhino-config v2.0 & rhino-update v1.2.1</h1>
                    <p>After a couple of weeks of development, rhino-config v2.0 has been completed. We have completely turned rhino-config into a command-line utility, written in Rust, with the help of our new maintainer, Wizard28. This means that support for the legacy python script will be dropping.</p>
                    <p>From now on, in order to be able to use rhino-config you must first update your system to pull the latest Rust binary from our repository. To do this, type <code>rhino-update</code> in your terminal. The full documentation for rhino-config has been updated and can be found <a href="https://rollingrhino.org/docs-rhino-config">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>&bull; If you would still like an interactive script, similar to the way that rhino-config was in version v1.2, you can run <code>rhino-config enable --interactive</code> to have it walk you through the options.</p>
                    <p>rhino-update has received a minor update, which will now download and install the latest rust binary for rhino-config. Along with this it now will install kernel 5.17.4 as opposed to 5.17.3. In order to ensure that updates are ran smoother, the .bashrc file will be replaced and all of our Rhino aliases will be moved to ~/.bash_aliases, so that we can update the bash aliases without any disruptive change to the system.</p>
                    <h2>Legacy rhino-config script</h2>
                    <p>The legacy rhino-config python script will still be available until the next disk image release, so that users who have not yet ran rhino-update will not receive any major breaking changes. The script will officially be deprecated as of 2022.05.03, and will automatically upgrade the user if they have not done so already. it is recommended that you run <code>rhino-update</code> to receive the latest change as soon as possible.</p>

                    <p>The Rolling Rhino Remix development team has worked closely with the development team of <a href="https://pacstall.dev">Pacstall</a> to bring their software onto our distribution. Pacstall is an AUR-inspired package manager for Ubuntu. It brings the experience of the Arch User Repository directly to Ubuntu and Ubuntu-based systems with an ever-growing number of user-maintained packages.</p>
                    <p>We have integrated, along with the help of the Pacstall development team, Pacstall directly into our Rhino utilities. Pacstall can now be enabled via <code>rhino-config</code> and all Pacstall applications can be updated via <code>rhino-update</code>.</p>

                    <p>After almost 3 weeks of hard work we have released the latest packaged version of Rolling Rhino Remix.</p>
                    <p>
                        <b>What's new?</b> <br/>
                        &bull; All packages have been updated to their latest versions in the Ubuntu repositories. <br/>
                        &bull; The <a href="https://github.com/rollingrhinoremix/rhino-config">rhino-config</a> utility has been created to extend the capabilities of rhino-update. <br/>

                        &bull; Code refactoring <br/>

                    <h2>The future of Rolling Rhino Remix</h2>
                    <p>This has been known for a while but all discussion and development for Rolling Rhino Remix now happens on our Discord, which you can join <a href="https://discord.gg/JMu4SYRs2n">here</a>.</p>
                    <p>From this release onwards all of our utilities, such as rhino-config and rhino-update, will be updated irrsepective of disk image releases. Large-scale changes to the utilities will still receive updates on our blog page. This will allow for users to get the latest and greatest changes to Rhino without any wait.</p>
                    <p>We have updated our website, it now uses server-side Jekyll to generate the pages rather than Eleventy being ran client-side then the generated pages being uploaded to GitHub. This will allow for people to make web-pages and fix our mistakes easier as they will be in pure Markdown as opposed to HTML.</p>
                    <p>The biggest change for the future of Rolling Rhino Remix is the integration of <a href="https://pacstall.dev">Pacstall</a>. We have worked along-side the developers of Pacstall to integrate their software into our Distribution. Pacstall provides a similar experience to the <a href="https://aur.archlinux.org">AUR</a> on Ubuntu, and working along-side these developers to integrate it into our Distribution will mean that you will have a new way to install bleeding-edge software onto your system.</p>
                    <p>As always, thanks to everyone who has shown an interest in the project, and a special thank you to our <a href="https://rollingrhino.org">developers & contributors</a> who have helped improve the project.</p>

                    <h1>Bug in 2022.03.26 - Requires manual intervention</h1>
                    <p>During the development cycle of 2022.04.14 I have noticed a bug that will affect currently existing versions of Rolling Rhino Remix (2022.03.26 is the only version released.), the bash alias that calls <code>rhino-update</code> runs the update.sh script as sudo, which has presented problems when we look for files in the user’s home directories. Luckily you are able to easily manually patch the system yourself.</p>
                    <p>The fix is fairly straightforward, all you will need is <code>git</code> and <code>mv</code>, both of which are provided in Rolling Rhino Remix</p>
                    <p>
                        To apply the fix, do the following: <br/>
                        &bull; cd ~ <br/>
                        &bull; git clone https://github.com/rollingrhinoremix/distro <br/>
                        &bull; mv ~/distro/.bashrc ~ <br/>
                        &bull; mv ~/distro/.bash_aliases
                    </p>
                    <p>and there you go, the fix has been applied and you will continue getting updates from us. The next update, which releases with 2022.04.14, will work as intended if you have applied this patch.</p>

                    <h1>Development underway for 2022.04.14!</h1>
                    <p>Development has gone underway for the next packaged .iso of Rolling Rhino Remix! This release won’t just be a newly compiled disk image with the latest updates. We are aiming to release a new update to the Rhino utility by the time we have released 2022.04.14. The new feature, rhino-config will at first only support the option to configure whether you would prefer to use the mainline Linux kernel or stick with the current Ubuntu kernel with all of their optimisations however support will be extended in the future to allow for the installation of proprietary drivers and other features too.</p>
                    <p>
                        This release has been delayed by an extra couple of days for two various reasons: <br/>
                        &bull; Due to conflicting schedules in personal lives we have had to delay the release, as preparing for a release takes a lot of work. <br/>
                        &bull; We are aiming to release rhino-config in this release and we are determined to do it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other changes in this future release include: <br/>
                        &bull; Us trialing a more automated process for .iso creation using a bash script, which will allow us more time to work on other features of the distribution, such as Rhino <br/>
                        &bull; Having the new disk images have the latest updates so users are not required to update a lot of packages upon installation.
